## Class Notes

### Administrative Stuff

* Attendance will be taken every day. If there is some reason that you are not able to be in class, then please let me know ASAP
* The class will be highly interactive which means:
  * There will be regular mini-quizzes posed by the instructor
  * There regular round-robin Q&A sessions
  * And by Q&A, it means that both you ask me questions, but I will also ask you questions
* We will break for lunch from 12-1
  * This is your time and will be respected
* There will be a 15 min break about 10:15-ish in the morning and one about 2:30-ish in the afternoon
* There will be no new material presented after about 4-4:30
  * That time will be for deep dive questions and related issues you might want to bring up

### Class Repo

* All materials I use in class, including these notes, will be in the student repository at
  * https://github.com/ExgnosisClasses/gitJenkins-Sept-13
  * The repo will be available until at least Oct 15
  * You may share the materials other than the slides with anyone
    * Provided you don't charge for them
    * The slides are not my intellectual property so....
    * Everything else is either my IP or commons licensed so it is free to share

### VMs
